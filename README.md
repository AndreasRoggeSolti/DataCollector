DataCollector
=============

This is a simple tool for merging table-like comma-separated files into one.
It can also transform(normalize) tables that contain multiple events in one row to seperate rows per event maintaining additional attributes of the row (case).

Basic relabeling of  columns & values is possible.

*Currently, most options are still hard-coded in the source.*
